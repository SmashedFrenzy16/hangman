# Hangman

A hangman game that I created. Thanks to Data Flair for giving me the code! Run `python3 hangman.py` in a terminal if you have Python 3. Please note that the code has one or two bugs, the most prominent one where the hangman person does not get formed if you have too many incorrect tries. This is because it resets your progress after you make an incorrect try.
